D-STEM (Distributed Space Time Expectation Maximization) is a statistical software for the analysis of space-time data sets and the prediction, uncertainty included, of the observed variables by means of hierarchical multivariate space-time models. D-STEM is developed in the MATLAB language and it requires MATLAB to run.

D-STEM is able to handle the following data sets:
  * Univariate data sets (one variable observed at multiple spatial locations and regular time steps)
  * Multivariate data sets (multiple variable observed at multiple and possibly different spatial locations and regular time steps)
  * Univariate and multivariate data sets with missing data
  * Multivariate data sets of point and pixel data on regular grids (the same variables observerd as both point and pixel data)
  * Large data sets

D-STEM provides the following features:
  * Model parameters estimation
  * Model parameter uncertainty estimation
  * Model log-likelihood estimation
  * Model cross-validation
  * Data fusion
  * Space-time mapping of the observed variables
  * Space-time mapping of uncertainty

D-STEM is developed and maintained by [Francesco Finazzi](http://www.unibg.it/pers/?francesco.finazzi) of the University of Bergamo, Italy and it is based on the hierarchical space-time models introduced by [Alessandro Fassò](http://www.unibg.it/pers/?alessandro.fasso) and Francesco Finazzi for the analysis of environmental data sets.
Francesco Finazzi and Alessandro Fassò are members of the [GRASPA](http://www.graspa.org/) research group on environmental statistics. Francesco Finazzi takes part in the research project [StEPhI](http://www.stephiproject.it/) - Statistics for Environmental Phenomena and their Interactions.
